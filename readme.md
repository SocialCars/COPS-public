# COPS Simulation

Requirements:

- Python 3.5
- SUMO 0.30.0

For more help on available commands run:

    python3 main.py -h

To generate documentation go to doc/ folder and run make.
To run tests (almost none atm) just run ``pytest`` in the root folder (where
``main.py`` is).

When testing erase config from home directory, in future writing config to home
directory should be avoided.
